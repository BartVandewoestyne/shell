# Script to prepare a vendor branch upgrade.
#
# TODO: this script is unfinished:
#
#   * Using Qt, I have seen that a file that is initially lower case (e.g. foo.cpp) and in the
#     new version has the same name but uppercase (e.g. FOO.cpp), will appear as follows in the
#     svn status:
#       foo.cpp => 'missing'
#       FOO.cpp => 'added'
#     The foo.cpp must then still be svn deleted manually.
#
#   * I experienced a problem with the Canon SDK: it tries to delete a filename with space in it:
#       svn: E200005: Use --force to override this restriction (local modifications may be lost)
#       svn: E200005: 'C:\Digital_EOS_SDK\Windows\Sample\diagram' is not under version control
#       svn: E155007: 'C:\of' is not a working copy
#       svn: E155007: 'C:\camera' is not a working copy
#       svn: E155007: 'C:\control.pdf' is not a working copy
#
# Prerequisites:
#   1. You have an extracted tarball/zip of the original source in dir_orig
#   2. You have a working copy that is an extracted tarball with the
#      svn source of the previous version checked out on top of it,
#      in $dir_working.
#
# Example usage:
#
#   => run Cygwin as root (TODO: check if this is necessary).
#   ./prepare_vendor_branch.sh cmake-3.13.4-orig cmake-3.13.4

#     for example:
#       foo@2.txt becomes foo@2.txt@
#     See also http://svnbook.red-bean.com/en/1.7/svn.advanced.pegrevs.html
#     Maybe we can even append an @ to every file???
#   - files in the root dir are not in files_to_svn_delete.txt???

# Are other modifications necessary?  Maybe case-sensitive related changes?
# The files that changed their capitalization, probably show up as missing.  I
# I think you can svn delete these, but then also check if their counterparts
# were svn added (or should we svn rename them?)
